  tagline: Fundamentals Computer Science on micro:bit!
  description: >
    This playlist takes you through fundamentals Computer Science on
    micro:bit. The playlist covers what a micro:bit is, how it works, how to use
    the various blocks in MakeCode and how to use the various Computer Science
    structures like Sequence, Selection and Iteration through to advanced
    features like using functions to make more modular and efficient
    programs.   The playlist also covers how to use the various features of the
    micro:bit's hardware like the sensors and accelerometer to create useful and
    interactive projects that you can make at home.   This playlist also include
    a list of 'Have a Go' activities that you can use to experiment with and
    challenge yourself by applying the theory in the videos.   This playlist is
    a fantastic introduction to Physical Computing and once you are confident
    with the theory you can explore our other playlist, Introduction to
    Computing with MicroPython' which goes on to using Python (a text-based
    programming language) to learn more about Computing and how to program.

  tagline: A YouTube series teaching Computer Science for A-Level/early University
  description: >
    In this series, we're going to trace the origins of our modern
    computers, take a closer look at the ideas that gave us our current hardware
    and software, discuss how and why our smart devices just keep getting
    smarter, and even look towards the future! Computers fill a crucial role in
    the function of our society, and it's our hope that over the course of this
    series you will gain a better understanding of how far computers have taken
    us and how far they may carry us into the future.
